### Description

IMPORTANT: Before you open the code rename systray.oc_x to systray.ocx

Safe proxy acts like a normal HTTP proxy but you can customize it to block out content. It is currently programmed to block out file uploads.
 
### More Info
 
For inputs all you need to do is setup your webbrowser and it does the inputs for you! :)

Internet explorer users: Tools menu -> Internet Options -> Connections Tab -> LAN Settings button -> Check Use Proxy Server -> Put in servers IP(whatever computer is running it) and the port: 8180

Press OK a couple times and your set :)

To undo go back to LAN settings and uncheck 'Use Proxy Server'

To do this, its much easier with 2 computers networked together. The one with internet access should run the proxy server.

It returns the page right back to the web browser :)

There is 1 sideeffect mainly but its not a big problem. As all proxy servers do, it will make the connection slower for the user requesting the page.
